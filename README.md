# Senior Systems Operations Engineer – PaaS – London/Remote – up to £90,000 

# Stack: 
Stack is Linux, AWS, Ansible, Terraform, Docker & Kubernetes (Testing and Staging). Python house. Moving towards 100% public hosted cloud model. 

# The company: 
A fast growth, well-funded, and already very successful PaaS travel company. They are 100 strong globally with 30 In London. Other offices are in the US, Sweden and Australia. 

# The culture: 
Very cool and product centric. The office has a great a vibe – calm and collected with the buzz of creation. The office is a large loft conversion with sound proof booths, state of the art comms rooms and my personal favourite perk – a free bar on the top floor stocked to the brim. 

# The role: 
Well there are actually two roles, that will either take a lead and junior dynamic, or a peer dynamic. They want to get the right people on board so are flexible. These two roles will be the first of their kind in the UK office and will be joining the global Operations function, working closely also with the founders and product teams who are based out of London. The Operations team are responsible for the end to end delivery of the travel platform and have complete autonomy over what technologies they use – the only rule is “be pragmatic and solve business problems”. In this role you will design, implement, and manage the cloud and container infrastructure, configuration management, automation, and monitoring/alerting strategies.

# Project examples: 
The current architecture simply will not support the growth of the business. The majority of the projects will be focused around designing and delivering the next generation platform. The target architecture will be microservices based running on AWS with either K8s and Docker or EKS (if the service is ready in time). There is currently an overly complex, unscalable, completely bespoke and undocumented Ansible legacy that needs to be deconstructed and rebuilt, most likely in Salt Stack. As you may have gathered… the policy is honesty when It comes to mistakes made at this company! Ultimately, this role will be interacting with the business owners, understanding their needs and then researching tech, putting together POC’s and then delivering. Your impact will be huge from day one… no passengers in this company.  

# What experience is required?
* Lots of experience and passion for automation
* Strong Linux of course with strong scripting, preferably Python
* Configuring AWS cloud implementations and Kubernetes
* Demonstrable experience with automation/config tools
* Hands-on end to end management of enterprise monitoring, back-up & recovery, and logging solutions
* You will also get involved in support… It’s follow the sun so no unholy hours but “you built it, you support it”
* Software development and HashiCorp experience a bonus

# Questions:
**What is the salary range?**
The guideline is up to £90,000 but as mentioned, they’ll go higher for the right person. Unfortunately, this/these roles require someone to the hit the ground running with little direction so junior and mid-level engineers won’t be considered. If your salary expectations start at £70,000+ you are likely in the right range

**Do they offer remote/flexible working?**
Yes. Flexible hours and WFH all OK and remote working is available once settled into the role. You would be expected to be in the office for certain meetings though. Especially TDA meets.

**Will you be required to travel?** 
No
